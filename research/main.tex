    With accurate solutions to the many-electron Schrodinger equation all
the chemistry could be derived from first principles, but analytical treatment is intractable due the intrinsic strong electron-electron correlations, anti symmetry and cusp behavior. Recently, due to its high flexibility deep learning approaches had been applied for this problem, neural wave functions models such as FermiNet and PauliNet have advanced accuracy, yet computational cost and error typically grows steeply with system size, limiting applicability to
larger molecules. They also lack of strong architectures designed to
capture long-range electronic correlations with scalable attention. In
this work I develop the Psiformer a transformer-based ansatz that
couples scalable attention with physics-aware structure. Training is
formulated within Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), evaluation will be do
it by comparing ground state energy against another traditional methods, I also outline design questions for further improvement, including sparsified/global
attention and optimizer choices inspired by recent transformer advances.

\section{Introduction}

The electronic structure problem remains challenging: the wave functions which fully describes the system lives in a \(3N\)-dimensional space where \(N\) is the number of electrons, each particle lives on the 3 dimensional space, molecules of interest for laboratory applications has around 10 atoms. Additionally, it must satisfy specific properties due to physical laws and live on the complex space.

Although the governing laws have been known for almost a century \cite{Schrodinger1926_undulatory}, obtaining practical approximations to the quantum many-body wavefunction remains difficult. Established approaches such as density-functional theory \cite{KohnSham1965}, Born Oppenheimer \cite{BornOppenheimer1927}, and structured variational ansätze \cite{McMillan1965GroundStateHe4} trade generality for tractability by
imposing specific functional forms or approximations to correlation.
These choices are effective within their regimes but can struggle for strongly correlated systems or scale poorly with electron count cite. This is where modern learning-based methods enter: instead of fixing the functional form, we learn it, while enforcing essential physics (antisymmetry, cusp behavior, permutation symmetry), here is where deep learning methods shines. This field has reshaped several scientific domains, from protein structure prediction \cite{jumper2021highly} to vision modeling \cite{dosovitskiy2021imageworth16x16words} and PDE surrogates \cite{RAISSI2019686}.
Motivated by these successes, the community has explored neural approaches for quantum many-body problems ,seeking accurate and scalable approximations to the many-electron wavefunction \cite{Luo_2019,Qiao_2020}.

Thus, neural wavefunction models have emerged as a promising alternative. Architectures such as \textbf{FermiNet} \cite{Pfau_2020} and \textbf{PauliNet} \cite{Hermann_2020} combine flexible function approximators with determinant structures to respect antisymmetry, improving variational expressivity. However, two practical limitations persist. First, error or compute cost often scales unfavorably with the number of electrons, restricting applicability to
larger molecules. Second, mechanisms for \textbf{long-range electronic
correlation} central to Coulomb and exchange effects are typically implicit or expensive to capture, leading to optimization difficulty and
brittle generalization.

Transformers offer an appealing direction. Self-attention provides
direct, many-to-many interactions among tokens in a single layer, is highly parallelizable, and has empirically favorable scaling behavior in other domains (Natural Language Processing \cite{Vaswani2017}. For electronic structure, where any electron can interact with any other and electron indices are exchangeable, attention aligns naturally with the physics: it enables global coupling without imposing an arbitrary ordering. The challenge is
to embed the right \textbf{inductive biases} (distance awareness, spin structure, cusp handling) and to maintain \textbf{fermionic antisymmetry} while keeping computational cost under control.

I develop \textbf{Psiformer} \cite{vonglehn2023selfattentionansatzabinitioquantum}, a transformer-based variational ansatz for
many-electron systems \cite{vonglehn2023selfattentionansatzabinitioquantum}. Psiformer uses self-attention to construct rich
per-electron features informed by electron--electron and
electron--nucleus descriptors, then imposes antisymmetry explicitly via
determinant-based heads. Physics-aware priors (e.g., distance/radial
encodings and cusp-motivated embeddings) are incorporated to reduce
sample complexity and stabilize training. The optimization is formulated within \textbf{Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)} by minimizing the variational energy.

\textbf{Contributions.} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item A transformer-based neural wavefunction (\textbf{Psiformer}) \cite{vonglehn2023selfattentionansatzabinitioquantum} implemented on Pytorch \cite{Paszke2019PyTorch} that separates correlation modeling (attention) from fermionic symmetry (determinant heads) while embedding Coulomb-aware priors. 
    \item A VMC training recipe with practical choices for stability (feature design, and optional natural-gradient preconditioning).
\end{itemize}

The objectives are the follow:

\section{Theoretical Framework}\label{sec:theo}

In this section, we develop the physical and mathematical foundation needed to understand the problem we study. We begin with the Schrödinger wave equation, which is central to non-relativistic quantum mechanics, later

\subsection{The wave function}

The Schrödinger equation describes how the quantum state of a physical system evolves in time. It arises from combining wave-particle duality (de Broglie hypothesis) with classical energy conservation, translated into operator form.

The concepts presented in this section provides the physical and mathematical background for our specific problem.

\subsubsection{The Schrodinger Equation}

The Schrodinger equation was presented in a series of publications made
it by Erwin Schrodinger in the year 1926 \cite{Schrodinger1926_undulatory}. There we search the complex
function \(\psi\) which lives on a Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\) called
\textbf{wave function}, for a non relativistic spinless single particle
this function depends on the position of the particle
\(\mathbf{\vec{r}}\) and time \(t\) \((\psi(\mathbf{\vec{r}},t))\), the
quantity \(\lvert \psi (\mathbf{r},t)\rvert^{2}\) is the
\textbf{probability density} to find the particle near \(\mathbf{r}\) at
time \(t\) \cite{Bohr1928Nature}.

Guided by de Broglie's discover \cite{deBroglie1924thesis} of the wave particle duality and a very smart intuition Schrodinger proposed the time dependent equation (TDSE):
\[ i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=\hat{H}\psi \] Where \(i\) is
the complex unit, \(\hbar\) is the Reduced Planck Constant [cite] approximate to \(1.054571817\dots \times 10^{-34} J\cdot s\) and \(\hat{H}\) is a Hermitian linear operator called the
\textbf{Hamiltonian} which represents the total energy of the system,
for a single non relativistic (low energy) particle of mass \(m\) in a
scalar potential \(V(\mathbf{r},t)\). \[
\hat{H}=\frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}{2m}+V(\mathbf{r},t)
\] Where \(\mathbf{\hat{p}}\) is the Momentum Operator and in the
\textbf{Position representation} it takes the form of: \[
\mathbf{\hat{p}}=-i\hbar \nabla
\] Where \(\nabla\) is the Laplacian operator, thus the TDSE is
explicitly: \[
i\hbar\,\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}
=
\left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}+V(\mathbf r,t)\right]\psi
\] The \textbf{time independent form} (TISE) could be derived from
equation ,when the wave function \(\psi\) could be written like the
product of two functions \(R\) and \(T\), where \(R\) depends uniquely
on the spatial term \((\mathbf{\vec{r}})\) and \(T\) uniquely on the
temporal \((t)\), this is: \[
\psi(\mathbf{\vec{r}},t)=R(\mathbf{\vec{r}})T(t)
\] Plugin this form on equation \textbf{number}, you can derive that: \[
T(t)=e^{ -iEt/\hbar }
\] Where \(E\),the energy of the system, is constant. You also obtain
that the spatial part is conditioned by: \[
\hat{H}R(\mathbf{\vec{r}})=ER(\mathbf{\vec{r}})
\] We are going to represent the spatial function \(R\) as \(\psi\). And
in this work we are going to only focus in the TDSE, when we treat with
constant energy, the electron are almost always found near the lowest
energy state, known as the ground state. Solutions with higher energy known as excited states are relevant to photochemistry , but in this work we will restrict our attention to ground states. \subsubsection{The many electron Schrodinger Equation}

When we are considering more than one single particle we consider the spin \((\sigma)\) and the interaction between particles. Thus in its time-independent form the Schrodinger equation can be written as an eigen value problem:

\[ \hat{H}\psi(\mathbf{x}_{0},\dots ,\mathbf{x}_{n})=E\psi(\mathbf{x}_{1},\dots ,\mathbf{x}_{n}) \]
Where \(\mathbf{x}_{i}=\{ \mathbf{r}_{i},\sigma \}\),
\(\mathbf{r}_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{3}\) is the position of each particle
and \(\sigma \in \{ \uparrow.\downarrow \}\) is the so called spin. It's
possible model the potential energy of a many body system (e.g atoms,
molecules), we first have to consider the repulsion between each
electrons: \[
V_{ij}
= \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}
  \frac{1}{\lvert \mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j} \rvert}
\] Here: - \(e = 1.602\,176\,634\times 10^{-19}\ \mathrm{C}\) is the
elementary charge, -
\(\varepsilon_{0} = 8.854\,187\,8128\times 10^{-12}\ \mathrm{F\,m^{-1}}\)
is the \textbf{electrical permittivity of vacuum}, - \(\mathbf{r}_i\) is
the position vector of electron \(i\) in the chosen reference frame. The
attraction between the proton \(I\) and the electron \(i\) is given by:
\[
V_{iI} = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}} \frac{eZ_{I}}{\lvert \mathbf{r}_{i} - \mathbf{R}_{I} \rvert}
\] Where \(Z_I\) is the atomic number of nucleus \(I\) (for instance, in
a Helium atom \(Z = 2\)) and \(\mathbf{R}_I\) is the position of that
nucleus from a chosen reference frame.\\
The reference frame is usually taken at the \textbf{center of mass} or
at the \textbf{center of the molecule}. The repulsion between the nuclei
\(I\) and \(J\) (protons) is: \[
V_{IJ} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}} \frac{Z_{I}Z_{J}}{\lvert \mathbf{R}_{I} - \mathbf{R}_{J} \rvert}
\] To avoid writing these constants every time, quantum chemistry
commonly uses \textbf{atomic units (a.u.)}. In this system, the unit of
length is the \textbf{Bohr radius} \(a_{0}\),\\
and the unit of energy is the \textbf{Hartree} \(E_{h}\): \[
E_{h} = \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0} a_{0}}
\] Under atomic units, \(e = 1\),
\(4\pi\varepsilon_{0} = 1\),\(\hbar = 1\), and \(m_{e} = 1\).\\
Thus, the potential energy of a system with \(N_{e}\) electron and
\(N_{n}\) nucleus can be written compactly as: \[
V = -\sum_{i=1}^{N_{e}}\sum_{I=1}^{N_{n}}  \frac{Z_I}{\lvert \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}_I \rvert}
+ \sum_{i>j} \frac{1}{\lvert \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j \rvert}
+ \sum_{I>J} \frac{Z_I Z_J}{\lvert \mathbf{R}_I - \mathbf{R}_J \rvert}
\]

where: - \(i, j\) index electrons. - \(I, J\) index nuclei. - The first
term represents \textbf{electron--nucleus attraction}. - The second term
is \textbf{electron--electron repulsion}. - The third term is
\textbf{nucleus--nucleus repulsion}. For the kinetic term we need to
consider two expressions: \(\nabla_i^2\) acts on the \textbf{electron}
coordinates \(\mathbf r_i\) (fast, light particles) and \(\nabla_I^2\)
acts on the \textbf{nuclear} coordinates \(\mathbf R_I\) (slow, heavy
particles). Let \(N\) electrons at \(\mathbf r_i\) and \(M\) nuclei at
\(\mathbf R_I\) with charges \(Z_I\) and masses \(M_I\) (in units of
\(m_e\)) then the \textbf{Hamiltonian} can be written as:

\begin{align}
\hat H &= -\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^{2} -\sum_{I=1}^{M}\frac{1}{2M_I}\nabla_{I}^{2} -\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{I=1}^{M}\frac{Z_I}{|\mathbf r_i-\mathbf R_I|}\\
+&\sum_{1\le i<j\le N}\frac{1}{|\mathbf r_i-\mathbf r_j|}+\sum_{1\le I<J\le M}\frac{Z_I Z_J}{|\mathbf R_I-\mathbf R_J|}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Conditions of the solution}

As with any differential equation, where one is searching one solution is important to consider initial conditions (IC) and boundary conditions (BC), here we have to fulfill certain conditions that comes from
physical laws.

Bosons (e.g., photons) follow \textbf{Bose--Einstein} statistics, whereas fermions (e.g., electrons, protons) follow \textbf{Fermi Dirac} statistics \cite{Fermi1926Quantelung, Dirac1926TheoryQM}, because at the microscopic level identical particles are
indistinguishable then the wave function should be equal but Pauli
Exclusion \cite{Pauli1925Exclusion} don't like that , the many-particle wave function must be \textbf{anti symmetric} under the exchange of any two fermions. This
implies: \[
\psi(\dots,\mathbf{x}_{i},\dots,\mathbf{x}_{j},\dots)=-\psi(\dots ,\mathbf{x}_{j},\dots ,\mathbf{x}_{i},\dots)
\] We can enforce \textbf{antisymmetry} using a \(N\times N\)
Slater determinant \cite{Slater1929TheoryComplexSpectra}, which involves one-particle states only (a wave function
with a single input) . An interchange of any pair of particles
corresponds to an interchange of two columns of the determinant; this
interchange introduces a change in the sign of the determinant. For even
permutations we have \((-1)^{P}=1\), and for odd permutations we have \((-1)^{P}=-1\). 

\begin{equation}
\Psi(\mathbf x_1,\ldots,\mathbf x_N)
\propto
\begin{vmatrix}
\phi_1(\mathbf x_1) & \phi_2(\mathbf x_1) & \cdots & \phi_N(\mathbf x_1)\\
\phi_1(\mathbf x_2) & \phi_2(\mathbf x_2) & \cdots & \phi_N(\mathbf x_2)\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
\phi_1(\mathbf x_N) & \phi_2(\mathbf x_N) & \cdots & \phi_N(\mathbf x_N)
\end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}
Where \(\phi_k\) are orthonormal (by construction) spin orbitals. This is, for instance
\((N=2)\): \[
\Psi(\mathbf x_1,\mathbf x_2)
\propto\Big[\phi_a(\mathbf x_1)\phi_b(\mathbf x_2)-\phi_a(\mathbf x_2)\phi_b(\mathbf x_1)\Big].
\]  

Kato Cusp Conditions

The potential energy becomes infinite, when particles overlap, which
places strict constraints on the form of the wave function at these
points, knows as the \textbf{Kato Cusp Conditions} \cite{Kato1957EigenfunctionsManyParticle}. The cusp conditions states that the wave function must be non-differentiable at these points, and give exact values for the average derivatives at the cusps. This can be obtained if we multiply to the ansatz by multiplying
by a Jastrow factor \(\mathcal{J}\)which satisfies these conditions
analytically \cite{Jastrow1955ManyBodyProblem}.

Electron-nucleus cusp (electron with charge
\(-1\), nucleus charge \(+Z\), reduced mass \(\mu \approx 1\))
\[\lim_{ riI \to 0 } \left( \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r_{iI}} \right)=-Z\psi(r_{iI}=0)
\] - Electron-electron cusp, opposite spins (charges \(-1\), reduced
mass \(\mu=\frac{1}{2}\)) \[
\lim_{ r_{ij}\to 0 } \left( \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r_{ij}} \right)=\frac{1}{2}\psi(r_{ij}=0)
\] Where \(r_{iI}(r_{ij})\) is an electron-nuclear (electron-electron)
distance, \(Z_{I}\) is the nuclear charge of the \(I\text{-th}\)
nucleous and ave implies a spherical averaging over all directions.

So that is the problem we need to find a \(\psi\) such that it satisfies all those conditions.

\subsubsection{Approximations to the problem}

Is clear that find analytical solutions is practically impossible, so what people have been doing is first apply good approximations.

\textbf{Born Oppenheimer approximation} \cite{BornOppenheimer1927} makes it possible to separate the motion of the nuclei and the motion of the electrons, neglects the
motion of the atomic nuclei when describing the electrons in a molecule.
The physical basis for the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is the fact
that the mass of an atomic nucleus in a molecule is much larger than the
mass of an electron (more than 1000 times). Because of this difference,
the nuclei move much more slowly than the electrons. In addition, due to
their opposite charges, there is a mutual attractive force of: acting on
an atomic nucleus and an electron. This force causes both particles to
be accelerated. Since the magnitude of the acceleration is inversely
proportional to the mass, \(a = f/m\), the acceleration of the electrons
is large and the acceleration of the atomic nuclei is small; the
difference is a factor of more than 1000. Consequently, the electrons
are moving and responding to forces very quickly, and the nuclei are
not, then we fix the nucleus, \(\mathbf{R}_{I}\) becomes a constant,
thus the kinetic term for nucleus becomes zero. And the potential energy
for the repulsion between nucleus becomes a constant. 

\begin{align}
\hat H_{\mathrm{el}} =
-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^{2}
-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{I=1}^{M}\frac{Z_I}{|\mathbf r_i-\mathbf R_I|}\\
+\sum_{1\le i<j\le N}\frac{1}{|\mathbf r_i-\mathbf r_j|}
+ \sum_{I<J}\frac{Z_I Z_J}{|\mathbf R_I-\mathbf R_J|}
\end{align}


This is the form that we are going to work with; a second useful
approach to the problem is use an \textbf{Ansatz}, which is a guess
solution guided by intuition, this normally depend on certain number of
parameters, then the problem becomes on optimize this \textbf{Ansatz}.

Another important matter are the complex numbers, we should to work with
them, no! Why is that? 

\subsubsection{Rayleigh Quotient}
We need a way to measure how well our Ansatz \(\psi_{\theta}\) is doing, if our ansatz is bad then don't reflect the truly form of the system, Deep learning approaches use data sets to train their ansatz (model initialized on randoms parameters) in this case we don't need any external but physical principles. Lets first introduce the \textbf{Rayleigh quotient}. If
\(A\) is an operator and \(x\) is a state, the number: 
\[
R_{A}(x)=\frac{ \langle x |A   |x\rangle}{\bra{x}x\rangle }
\] 
is the \textbf{expectation value} of that operator in that state. The
important for us is that if \(\psi\) is a wave function and \(\hat{H}\)
the \textbf{Hamiltonian}, then the Rayleigh quotient: 
\[
R_{\hat{H}}(\psi)=\frac{\braket{ \psi | \hat{H}| \psi}}{\braket{ \psi | \psi } }
\] is the average (expected) energy of the system when it is in the state \(\psi\) \cite{Ritz1909Variational}.

\subsubsection{Variational Principle} 

The Variational Principle states that the expectation value
for the binding energy obtained using an approximate wave function and
the exact Hamiltonian operator will be higher than or equal to the true
energy for the system. This idea is really powerful. When implemented it
permits us to find the best approximate wavefunction from a given
wavefunction that contains one or more adjustable parameters, called a
trial wavefunction \cite{foulkes2001quantum, } . A mathematical statement of the variational
principle is. \[
R_{\hat{H}}(\psi_{\text{ansatz}})\geq R_{\hat{H}}(\psi_{\text{true}})
\] The true ground-state wave function \(\psi_{\text{true}}\) is the one
that minimizes the rayleigh quotient. \[
\psi_{0}=\underset{\psi}{\text{argmin}}( R_{\hat{H}}(\psi))
\] So if we minimize the rayleigh quotient of our ansatz we are going to
be more near of the true wave function. 


\subsubsection{Variational Monte Carlo}

To the process that we are going to use for optimize our ansatz is called Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)\cite{McMillan1965GroundStateHe4,bajdich2006pfaffian}. Now we can see to the rayleigh
quotient as a loss function \(\mathcal{L}\) with the form of. \[
\mathcal{L}(\Psi_{\theta})=\frac{\bra{\Psi_{\theta}} \hat{H}\ket{\Psi_{\theta}} }{\braket{ \Psi_{\theta} | \Psi _{\theta}} }=\frac{\int d\mathbf{r}\Psi ^{*}(\mathbf{r})\hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r})}{\int d\mathbf{r}\Psi ^{*}(\mathbf{r})\Psi(\mathbf{r})}
\] Evaluate that integral is hard, another smart approach is the follow,
define a probability distribution \(p_{\theta}\) with the follow form:
\[
p_{\theta}(x)=\frac{\lvert \Psi_{\theta} (x)\rvert ^{2}}{\int dx'\Psi^{2}_{\theta}(x')}
\] Realize that for compute \(p_{\theta}(x)\) for a specific \(x\) is
complicated due the integral that appears, this is going to be important
later. Defining the local energy \(E_{L}\) with: \[
E_{L}(x)=\Psi ^{-1}_{\theta}(x)\hat{H}\Psi_{\theta}(x)
\] Then the loss becomes: \[
\mathcal{L}(\Psi_{\theta})=\int \frac{ \hat{H}\Psi_{\theta}(x)}{\Psi_{\theta}(x)}p_{\theta}(x)dx
\] Which is the expected value of the local energy: \[
\mathcal{L}(\Psi_{\theta})=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\theta}}[E_{L}(x)]
\] To optimize our wave function we know by deep learning that we need
evaluate that expectation and obtain the derivative for back
propagation, how we make that? We are going to use the the Monte Carlo
estimator \cite{MetropolisUlam1949}: \[
\mathcal{L}_{\theta}=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\theta}}[E_{L}(x)]\approx \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{M} E_{L}(\mathbf{R}_{k})
\] Whit \(\mathbf{R}_{k}\) are samples from the \(p_{\theta}\)
probability distribution. This is \[
\mathbf{R}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{R}_{M}\sim p_{\theta}(\mathbf{R})
\] We obtain \(E_{L}\) using: \[
E_{L}(\mathbf{R}_{k})=\frac{\hat{H}\psi(\mathbf{R}_{k})}{\psi(\mathbf{R}_{k})}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\nabla^{2}\psi(\mathbf{R_{k}})}{\psi(\mathbf{R}_{k})}+V(\mathbf{R}_{k})
\] Calculus tell us that for a any derivable function \(f\). \[
\frac{\nabla^{2}f}{f}=[\nabla^{2}\log f+(\nabla f)^{2}]
\] 
In practice is more numerically stable work using that form, thus: 
\begin{align}
&E_{L}(\mathbf{R}_{k})= \\& -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{3} \left[ \frac{\partial ^{2} \log \lvert \Psi(x) \rvert }{\partial r_{ij}^{2}}+\left( \frac{\partial \log \lvert \Psi(x) \rvert }{\partial r_{ij}} \right)^{2} \right]+V(\mathbf{R_{k}})    
\end{align}
The gradient of the energy respect to the parameters by a
parameterized wave functions is: 
\[
\nabla _{\theta}\mathcal{L}=2\mathbb{E}_{x\sim \Psi^{2}}[(E_{L}(x)-\mathbb{E}_{x'\sim\Psi^{2}}[E_{L}(x')])\nabla \log \lvert \Psi(x) \rvert ]
\] 

\subsubsection{Metropolis Hastings Algorithm}
To obtain samples from the probability distribution \(p_{\theta}\) we are going to use the Metropolis Hasting algorithm (MH) \cite{Metropolis1953Equation} which is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method used to obtain a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution. The
reason to use this method over another well knows methods (e.g.~example)
is that MH don't suffer of the \textit{Curse of Dimensionality} this is, it remains strong while increase the dimension of the problem, and since we are going to be working on dimension around ten is efficient
use this method. The algorithm works like follow:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Take a initial configuration \(\mathbf{X}_{0}\in E\) arbitrary:
\item
  Propose \(\mathbf{X}'=\mathbf{X}_{0}+\eta\) ,where
  \(\eta \sim q(\eta)\), \(q\) is a probability density on \(E\) called
  \textbf{proposal kernel}. In our case we are going to a symmetric Gaussian.
\item
  Compute the quantity: \[
  A(\mathbf{X_{0}}, \mathbf{X}')=\text{min}\left( 1,\frac{\rho(\mathbf{X}')}{\rho(\mathbf{X}_{0})} \frac{q(\mathbf{X}'-\mathbf{X}_{0})}{q(\mathbf{X}_{0}-\mathbf{X}')}\right)
  \] Where \(\rho\) is the target distribution where we want sample, In
  the case where \(q\) is symmetric, this simplifies to: \[
  A(\mathbf{X}_{0},\mathbf{X}')=\text{min}\left( 1,\frac{\rho(\mathbf{X})}{\rho(\mathbf{X}_{0})} \right)
  \] Note that in our case \(\rho\) is equal to \(p_{\theta}\), we said
  that compute the integral factor remains a challenge, but in this case
  we have it. \[
  \frac{p_{\theta}(\mathbf{X}')}{p_{\theta}(\mathbf{X}_{0})}=\frac{\lvert \psi_{\theta}(\mathbf{X}') \rvert ^{2}/\int \lvert \psi_{\theta} \rvert ^{2}dx}{\lvert \psi_{\theta}(\mathbf{X}_{0}) \rvert ^{2}/\int \lvert \psi_{\theta} \rvert ^{2}dx}=\frac{\lvert \psi_{\theta}(\mathbf{X'}) \rvert ^{2}}{\lvert \psi_{\theta}(\mathbf{X}_{0}) \rvert ^{2}}
  \]
\item
  Generate a uniform number \(U\in[0,1]\)
\item
  If: \(U<A(\mathbf{X}_{0}\to \mathbf{X'}_{l})\) then
  \(\mathbf{X_{1}}=\mathbf{X}'\), otherwise try another \(\mathbf{X}'\).
  Accept or decline.
\item
  Repeat until obtain \(N_{eq}\) accepted sample, the changes stabilizes
  (we reach a stationary distribution) this phase is called \textbf{burn
  in}.
\item
  From \(\mathbf{X}_{N_{\text{eq}}}\) generate \(M\) samples until reach
  the sample \(\mathbf{X}_{N_{\text{eq}}+M+1}\). In each sample
  generates \(E_{L}(\mathbf{R}_{k})\) then average to obtain
  \(\mathbb{E}(E_{L})\) and with it and the derivative from equation
  number {[}number{]} we are able to begin the back propagation step.
  
\subsection{Deep Learning Fundamentals} 

This subsection introduces the core concepts of Deep Learning that are going to be applied in this work.

\subsubsection{Multi Layer Perceptron}
A multi layer perceptron (MLP) is a nonlinear function \(\mathcal{F}:\mathbb{R}^{\text{in}}\to \mathbb{R}^{\text{out}}\) \cite{RumelhartHintonWilliams1986}
, it actually is the composition of
  \(L\) layers, the first layer is called the input layer, the last
  output layer and the intermediates hidden layers. In each layer we
  find a arbitrary number of neurons although is a good practice always
  choose number which are powers of two and an affine map
  \(\mathbf{z}^{(l)},l\in \{ L,L-1,\dots,2 \}\) (\(l=1\) is the input
  layer) of the follow form. \[
  \mathbf{z}^{(l)}=\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\mathbf{a}^{(l-1)}+\mathbf{b}^{(l)}
  \] Where \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\) called weight matrix and
  \(\mathbf{b}^{(l)}\) the bias vector of the \(l\) layer. We use a
  non-linear function \(\sigma ^{(l)}\) in the \(l\) layer (typically
  Softmax, ReLu, Tanh), thus the output of each layer is:
  \[ f^{(l)}=\sigma ^{(l)}\circ \mathbf{z}^{(l)} \] Where \(\circ\)
  means composition. A MLP is the composition of all the layers. \[
  \mathcal{F}=f^{(L)}\circ f^{(L-1)}\circ\dots \circ f^{(1)}
  \] We call parameters to the set of all the weights and bias of each
  layer. And represented it with the symbol \(\theta\).
  \[\{ \mathbf{W}^{(l)},\mathbf{b}^{(l)}\}_{l=2}^{L}=\theta\] You
  typically train a MLP, using a training data set, a loss function (e.g
  Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Cross entropy) and an
  optimizer (e.g GD, SGD, ADAM). Additionally you can use regularization
  techniques such as dropout to improve the generalization of the Net.

\subsubsection{Natural gradient Descent}\label{natural-gradient-descent}

As we mentioned, there are many ways to update the parameters of a
neural network: Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent,
Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM), etc. All of them
implicitly assume that the parameter space
\(\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) is equipped with the standard Euclidean
metric, so that ``length'' and ``steepest descent'' are measured with
respect to \(\|\Delta\theta\|_2\).

In our case the loss \(\mathcal{L}(\theta)\) depends on a probability
distribution \(p_\theta\), not just on \(\theta\) directly. For example,
in variational Monte Carlo we take \[
p_\theta(x)
= \frac{|\psi_\theta(x)|^2}{\displaystyle \int |\psi_\theta(x')|^2\,dx'} ,
\] so \(\theta\) parametrizes an entire family of probability densities
over configurations \(x\). It is therefore more natural to measure
distances between \emph{distributions} \(p_\theta\) and
\(p_{\theta+\Delta\theta}\), rather than between the parameter vectors
themselves.

A canonical way to measure the distance between nearby probability
distributions is the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence \[
\mathrm{KL}\big(p_\theta \,\|\, p_{\theta+\Delta\theta}\big)
= \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_\theta}\!\left[\log\frac{p_\theta(x)}{p_{\theta+\Delta\theta}(x)}\right].
\] For small steps \(\Delta\theta\) one can show that a second--order
Taylor expansion of the KL gives \[
\mathrm{KL}\big(p_\theta \,\|\, p_{\theta+\Delta\theta}\big)
= \tfrac12\,\Delta\theta^\top \mathcal{F}(\theta)\,\Delta\theta + \mathcal{O}(\|\Delta\theta\|^3),
\] where \(\mathcal{F}(\theta)\) is the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) \cite{Fisher1922Foundations}.
To define it, introduce the \textbf{score function} 
\[
s_\theta(x) = \nabla_\theta \log p(x\mid \theta) \in \mathbb{R}^d
\] 
then the FIM is:
\[
\mathcal{F}(\theta)
= \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p(\cdot\mid\theta)}\!\big[\,s_\theta(x)\,s_\theta(x)^{\mathsf T}\big].
\]

The set of distributions \[
\mathcal{M} = \{\, p_\theta(z)\;|\; \theta \in \Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d \,\}
\] can be viewed as a differentiable manifold, and
\(\mathcal{F}(\theta)\) defines a Riemannian metric on its tangent
space. Concretely, for tangent vectors \(u,v \in \mathbb{R}^d\) at
\(\theta\) we define the inner product \[
\langle u,v \rangle_\theta
= u^{\mathsf T}\,\mathcal{F}(\theta)\,v.
\] This metric says: two parameter directions are ``close'' if they
induce similar infinitesimal changes in the \emph{distribution}
\(p_\theta\).

Now ask the usual steepest--descent question, but with this
non-Euclidean metric:

Find the direction \(\Delta\theta\) that decreases
\(\mathcal{L}(\theta)\) the fastest, among all directions with fixed
``length''
\(\|\Delta\theta\|_\theta^2 = \Delta\theta^\top \mathcal{F}(\theta)\,\Delta\theta\).

Solving this constrained optimization problem (e.g.~with Lagrange
multipliers) yields the \textbf{natural gradient} direction \cite{Amari1998NaturalGW}
\[
\Delta\theta_{\text{nat}} \;\propto\; -\,\mathcal{F}(\theta)^{-1}\,\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta).
\]
Thus the natural gradient descent update is \[
\Delta\theta_{\text{nat}}
= -\,\eta\,\mathcal{F}(\theta)^{-1}\,\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta),
\] where \(\eta>0\) is a step size. Compared with the usual gradient
\(\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}\), the factor \(\mathcal{F}^{-1}\)
``preconditions'' the gradient by the local geometry of the model's
probability distribution: directions that barely change \(p_\theta\) are
amplified, directions that change it a lot are damped.

Natural gradient descent is therefore meaningful exactly in the
situation we care about: when the loss depends on the parameters
\emph{through} a probability model \(p_\theta\) (e.g.~likelihood,
cross-entropy, KL, variational objectives, variational Monte Carlo
energy, etc.).

\subsubsection{Kronecker Factored Approximate Curvature}\label{kronecker-factored-approximate-curvature}

Directly computing and inverting the full Fisher matrix
\(\mathcal{F}(\theta)\) is infeasible for modern neural networks, since
\(\theta\) can have millions of components. Kronecker Factored
Approximate Curvature (KFAC) \cite{MartensGrosse2015KFAC} is an efficient approximation that makes
natural gradient updates practical for layered networks.

We sketch the construction for a fully connected layer \(\ell\) with
weight matrix \(W_\ell\) and (for simplicity) no bias. Bias terms can be
included by augmenting the activations with a constant \(1\); we comment
on this below.

\textbf{Forward definition of \(\mathbf{a}_\ell\)}

Consider a standard MLP. For a single input sample \(x\), the forward
pass at layer \(\ell\) is

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Input (activation) to layer \(\ell\)}: \[
  \mathbf{a}_\ell \in \mathbb{R}^{n_\ell}
  \] This is the column vector of activations coming into layer
  \(\ell\). For the first hidden layer, \(\mathbf{a}_1\) is just the
  (possibly preprocessed) input. For deeper layers it is the
  nonlinearity output from the previous layer.
\item
  \textbf{Pre-activation at layer \(\ell\)}: \[
  \mathbf{h}_\ell = W_\ell \,\mathbf{a}_\ell,
  \] where \(W_\ell \in \mathbb{R}^{m_\ell \times n_\ell}\).
\item
  \textbf{Output activation of layer \(\ell\)}: \[
  \tilde{\mathbf{a}}_\ell = \phi(\mathbf{h}_\ell),
  \] where \(\phi\) is applied element-wise. In many notations
  \(\tilde{\mathbf{a}}_\ell\) would become the input to the next layer,
  but to keep notation consistent with the Fisher block for \(W_\ell\),
  we explicitly distinguish:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    \(\mathbf{a}_\ell\): input to \(W_\ell\),
  \item
    \(\mathbf{h}_\ell\): pre-activation,
  \item
    \(\tilde{\mathbf{a}}_\ell\): output activation of layer \(\ell\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In KFAC, when we talk about \(\mathbf{a}_\ell\) for the Fisher block of
\(W_\ell\), we always mean ``the vector that \(W_\ell\) multiplies on
the right''. 

\textbf{Backward definition of \(\mathbf{e}_\ell\)} 

Let the loss for a single sample be \(\mathcal{L}(\theta)\) (for example,
negative log-likelihood or negative log of the wave-function
probability). Define the \textbf{backward sensitivity} (or error signal)
at layer \(\ell\) as \[
\mathbf{e}_\ell
= \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{h}_\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^{m_\ell}.
\] This is computed via backpropagation: - At the output layer \(L\): \[
  \mathbf{e}_L
  = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{h}_L}
  = \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \tilde{\mathbf{a}}_L}\right) \odot \phi'(\mathbf{h}_L),
  \] where \(\odot\) is the element-wise product or also Hadamard
product. - For hidden layers \(\ell < L\): \[
  \mathbf{e}_\ell
  = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{h}_\ell}
  = \left(W_{\ell+1}^{\mathsf T} \mathbf{e}_{\ell+1}\right) \odot \phi'(\mathbf{h}_\ell).
\] In the context of natural gradient for probabilistic models,
\(\mathcal{L}\) is often chosen as \(-\log p(X\mid\theta)\), so up to a
sign we can also think of \(\mathbf{e}_\ell\) as \[
\mathbf{e}_\ell = \frac{\partial \log p(X\mid\theta)}{\partial \mathbf{h}_\ell}.
\]  

\textbf{Gradient w.r.t. \(W_\ell\) and the form \(\mathbf{a}_\ell \otimes \mathbf{e}_\ell\)}


For a single sample, using the chain rule, \[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_\ell}
= \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{h}_\ell}
  \frac{\partial \mathbf{h}_\ell}{\partial W_\ell}
= \mathbf{e}_\ell\, \mathbf{a}_\ell^{\mathsf T}.
\]

If instead of \(\mathcal{L}\) we use \(\log p(X\mid\theta)\) (as in the
Fisher definition), we get \[
\frac{\partial \log p(X\mid\theta)}{\partial W_\ell}
= \mathbf{e}_\ell\, \mathbf{a}_\ell^{\mathsf T},
\] with
\(\mathbf{e}_\ell = \partial \log p / \partial \mathbf{h}_\ell\).

Now vectorize the gradient. Using the standard identity \[
\mathrm{vec}(uv^{\mathsf T}) = v \otimes u,
\] with \(u = \mathbf{e}_\ell\) and \(v = \mathbf{a}_\ell\), we obtain
\[
\frac{\partial \log p(X\mid\theta)}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(W_\ell)}
= \mathrm{vec}\!\left(\frac{\partial \log p}{\partial W_\ell}\right)
= \mathrm{vec}(\mathbf{e}_\ell\,\mathbf{a}_\ell^{\mathsf T})
= \mathbf{a}_\ell \otimes \mathbf{e}_\ell.
\]

This gives the key structural form used by KFAC.

\textbf{Fisher block for a single layer}

The Fisher block associated with the parameters \(W_\ell\) is \[
\mathcal{F}_\ell
= \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}\!\left[
\frac{\partial \log p(X\mid\theta)}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(W_\ell)}
\frac{\partial \log p(X\mid\theta)}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(W_\ell)}^{\mathsf T}
\right].
\]

Plugging in the expression above, \[
\mathcal{F}_\ell
= \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}\!\big[
(\mathbf{a}_\ell \otimes \mathbf{e}_\ell)
(\mathbf{a}_\ell \otimes \mathbf{e}_\ell)^{\mathsf T}
\big].
\]

Here \(p(\mathbf{X})\) denotes the distribution over inputs and labels
(or configurations, in the VMC case). In practice this expectation is
approximated by averaging over a mini-batch of samples \(X\) and the
corresponding forward/backward passes that produce \(\mathbf{a}_\ell\)
and \(\mathbf{e}_\ell\).

Computing and inverting \(\mathcal{F}_\ell\) directly is still
expensive, because its dimension is \[
(\text{dim}(\mathbf{a}_\ell)\,\text{dim}(\mathbf{e}_\ell))
\times
(\text{dim}(\mathbf{a}_\ell)\,\text{dim}(\mathbf{e}_\ell)).
\] KFAC makes two key approximations to make this tractable.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Block--diagonal across layers.}\\
  Off--diagonal blocks \(\mathcal{F}_{ij}\) are assumed negligible when
  \(\theta_i\) and \(\theta_j\) belong to different layers. This makes
  the Fisher approximately block--diagonal, with one block per layer.
\item
  \textbf{Kronecker factorization within each layer.}\\
  Inside a layer, KFAC assumes that the correlation between activations
  and errors factorizes: 

  \begin{align}  
  \mathcal{F}_\ell
  =& \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}\!\big[
  (\mathbf{a}_\ell \otimes \mathbf{e}_\ell)
  (\mathbf{a}_\ell \otimes \mathbf{e}_\ell)^{\mathsf T}
  \big]
  \\=& \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}\!\big[
  (\mathbf{a}_\ell\mathbf{a}_\ell^{\mathsf T}) \otimes
  (\mathbf{e}_\ell\mathbf{e}_\ell^{\mathsf T})
  \big]
  \\\approx &
  \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}[\mathbf{a}_\ell\mathbf{a}_\ell^{\mathsf T}]
  \;\otimes\;
  \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}[\mathbf{e}_\ell\mathbf{e}_\ell^{\mathsf T}]
  \end{align}
  
\end{enumerate}

Define the \emph{activation covariance} and \emph{error covariance}: \[
A_\ell = \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}[\mathbf{a}_\ell\mathbf{a}_\ell^{\mathsf T}],
\qquad
S_\ell = \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}[\mathbf{e}_\ell\mathbf{e}_\ell^{\mathsf T}].
\] In practice these expectations are updated as running averages over
mini-batches: \[
A_\ell \approx \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \mathbf{a}_\ell^{(b)} \mathbf{a}_\ell^{(b)\mathsf T},
\qquad
S_\ell \approx \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \mathbf{e}_\ell^{(b)} \mathbf{e}_\ell^{(b)\mathsf T},
\] where \(b\) indexes samples in the batch and
\(\mathbf{a}_\ell^{(b)}, \mathbf{e}_\ell^{(b)}\) are obtained by a
standard forward and backward pass for that sample. With this
approximation we have \[
\mathcal{F}_\ell \approx A_\ell \otimes S_\ell.
\]

The crucial property of the Kronecker product is that \[
(A_\ell \otimes S_\ell)^{-1}
= A_\ell^{-1} \otimes S_\ell^{-1},
\] so the inverse of the (huge) layer--Fisher block can be obtained by
inverting the much smaller matrices \(A_\ell\) and \(S_\ell\). Thus the
natural gradient update for the weights of layer \(\ell\) becomes \[
\Delta\theta_{\text{nat},\ell}
\approx -\,\eta\,\big(A_\ell^{-1} \otimes S_\ell^{-1}\big)\,
\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}(W_\ell)} \mathcal{L}.
\]

In summary, KFAC replaces the intractable inverse \[
\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}\big[ (\mathbf{a}_\ell\otimes \mathbf{e}_\ell)
(\mathbf{a}_\ell\otimes \mathbf{e}_\ell)^{\mathsf T} \big]^{-1}
\] by the efficiently computable:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}_{\ell}^{-1} = & \; \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}\big[(\mathbf{a}_\ell\otimes \mathbf{e}_\ell)
(\mathbf{a}_\ell\otimes \mathbf{e}_\ell)^{\mathsf T}\big]^{-1}
\\ \approx & \;  
\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}[\mathbf{a}_\ell\mathbf{a}_\ell^{\mathsf T}]^{-1}
\otimes
\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{X})}[\mathbf{e}_\ell\mathbf{e}_\ell^{\mathsf T}]^{-1}
\end{align}

which captures the dominant curvature structure while keeping the
cost of natural gradient descent comparable to standard first--order
methods. We have ignored biases above for clarity. In practice one can
either (i) augment \(\mathbf{a}_\ell\) with a constant \(1\) to absorb
biases into \(W_\ell\), or (ii) maintain separate smaller KFAC factors
for biases; both approaches preserve the same Kronecker structure.

\subsubsection{Self-Attention and Multi-Head Self-Attention}\label{self-attention-and-multi-head-self-attention}

\textbf{Attention Mechanisms}
The idea of an \emph{attention mechanism} was introduced in neural
machine translation by Bahdanau et al. @bahdanau2014neural Instead of
compressing an entire input sequence into a single fixed-size vector,
the model learns to \textbf{focus} on different parts of the input when
generating each output token.

Given a query vector \(\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h}\) and a set of
key--value pairs \(\{(\mathbf{k}_j, \mathbf{v}_j)\}_{j=1}^T\) with
\(\mathbf{k}_j, \mathbf{v}_j \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h}\), the (scaled
dot--product) attention mechanism computes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Compatibility scores} \[
  e_j \;=\; \frac{\mathbf{q}^\top \mathbf{k}_j}{\sqrt{d_h}}, \qquad j = 1,\dots,T,
  \]
\item
  \textbf{Normalized attention weights} \[
  \alpha_j \;=\; \frac{\exp(e_j)}{\sum_{m=1}^{T} \exp(e_m)}
  \;=\; \text{Softmax}_j\!\left( \frac{\mathbf{q}^\top \mathbf{k}_j}{\sqrt{d_h}} \right),
  \]
\item
  \textbf{Weighted sum of values} \[
  \mathbf{o} \;=\; \sum_{j=1}^{T} \alpha_j \mathbf{v}_j.
  \] 
\end{enumerate}

Intuitively, the query \(\mathbf{q}\) asks: \emph{``which elements
  of the set are relevant to me now?''} The keys \(\mathbf{k}_j\) encode \emph{what each element offers}, and the values \(\mathbf{v}_j\) encode \emph{what we take from each
  element once we decide to pay attention to it}.

In \textbf{self-attention}, the queries, keys, and values are all
obtained from the \textbf{same} set of input vectors.\\
Consider a sequence of input embeddings \[
\mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_T \in \mathbb{R}^{d},
\] and stack them into a matrix \[
\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d}, \quad
\mathbf{X} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{x}_1^\top \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{x}_T^\top
\end{bmatrix}.
\] To build one attention \textbf{head} of dimension \(d_h\), we
introduce three learnable matrices: \[
\mathbf{W}^Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_h}, \quad
\mathbf{W}^K \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_h}, \quad
\mathbf{W}^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_h}.
\] We then compute queries, keys, and values: 
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}^Q \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d_h}\\
    \mathbf{K} = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}^K \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d_h}\\
    \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}^V \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d_h}
\end{align}

The \textbf{scaled dot-product self-attention} for this head is: \[
\text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V})
= \text{Softmax}\!\left( \frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^\top}{\sqrt{d_h}} \right) \mathbf{V},
\] where the softmax is applied row-wise. Element-wise, the output at
position \(t\) is \[
\mathbf{o}_t = \sum_{j=1}^{T} \alpha_{tj} \mathbf{v}_j \; \text{with} \
\alpha_{tj} = \frac{\exp\!\left( \mathbf{q}_t^\top \mathbf{k}_j / \sqrt{d_h} \right)}{\sum_{m=1}^{T} \exp\!\left( \mathbf{q}_t^\top \mathbf{k}_m / \sqrt{d_h} \right)}.
\] You can think of this as: \emph{each position \(t\) in the sequence
``looks at'' every other position \(j\) and decides how much to care
about it}. \

\textbf{Multi-Head Self-Attention}

A single head can only look at interactions in one ``representation
subspace'' of dimension \(d_h\).\\
\textbf{Multi-head attention} uses several heads in parallel, each with
its own projection matrices, so that different types of relationships
can be captured simultaneously. Let \(n_h\) be the number of heads. For
head \(i = 1, \dots, n_h\) we have \[
\mathbf{W}_i^Q,\, \mathbf{W}_i^K,\, \mathbf{W}_i^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_h}.
\]

Head \(i\) computes: \[
\text{head}_i(\mathbf{X})
= \text{Attention}(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}_i^Q,\, \mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}_i^K,\, \mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}_i^V)
\in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d_h}.
\] The outputs of all heads are concatenated along the feature dimension
and then linearly mixed: \[
\mathbf{U} 
= \left[ \text{head}_1(\mathbf{X}) \,;\, \dots \,;\, \text{head}_{n_h}(\mathbf{X}) \right]
\in \mathbb{R}^{T \times (n_h d_h)},
\] \[
\mathbf{O} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{W}^O, \qquad
\mathbf{W}^O \in \mathbb{R}^{(n_h d_h) \times d}.
\] If we focus on one time step \(t\) and head \(i\), we can write the
per-head output as \[
\mathbf{o}_{t,i} = \sum_{j=1}^{T} 
\text{Softmax}_j\!\left( \frac{\mathbf{q}_{t,i}^\top \mathbf{k}_{j,i}}{\sqrt{d_h}} \right)\mathbf{v}_{j,i},
\] and the final vector at time \(t\) after concatenation and output
projection as \[
\mathbf{u}_t =
\mathbf{W}^{O} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{o}_{t,1} \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{o}_{t,n_h}
\end{bmatrix}.
\] From a physics point of view, you can read multi-head attention as
\textbf{several different ``channels'' of interaction}: one head might
focus on short-range relations, another on long-range ones, another on
some specific pattern (e.g.~symmetry, local structure), and so on.

\subsubsection{Transformer Architecture}\label{transformer-architecture}
The \textbf{Transformer} was introduced 
with the slogan \emph{``Attention Is All You Need.''} \cite{Vaswani2017}. Its core building block is a \textbf{layer} that combines: 1. \textbf{Multi-head self-attention}\\
2. \textbf{Position-wise feed-forward network (FFN)} Both sublayers use
\textbf{residual connections} and \textbf{layer normalization}. For an
input sequence \(\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d}\) (already
including positional information), one Transformer layer performs: 3.
\textbf{Multi-head self-attention sublayer} \[
   \mathbf{H} = \text{MHA}(\mathbf{X}), \qquad
   \mathbf{X}^{(1)} = \text{LayerNorm}\!\left( \mathbf{X} + \mathbf{H} \right).
\] 4. \textbf{Feed-forward sublayer} (applied independently at each
position) \[
   \text{FFN}(\mathbf{x}) = \sigma\!\left( \mathbf{x}\mathbf{W}_1 + \mathbf{b}_1 \right)\mathbf{W}_2 + \mathbf{b}_2,
\] typically with \(\sigma\) a nonlinearity such as ReLU or GELU and an
intermediate width \(d_{\text{ff}} > d\). At the sequence level:\\
\[
   \mathbf{Z} = \text{FFN}(\mathbf{X}^{(1)}), \qquad
   \mathbf{X}^{\text{out}} = \text{LayerNorm}\!\left( \mathbf{X}^{(1)} + \mathbf{Z} \right).
\] Stacking several such layers yields a deep architecture where, at
each layer, every position can interact with every other position
through self-attention.

In the original formulation \cite{Vaswani2017}, \textbf{positional encodings} (sinusoidal
or learned) are added to the embeddings so that the model can
distinguish different positions in the sequence: \[
\mathbf{X}_0 = \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P},
\] where \(\mathbf{E}\) are token embeddings and \(\mathbf{P}\) are
positional encodings.

\subsubsection{Why Transformers Instead of RNNs or
LSTMs?}\label{why-transformers-instead-of-rnns-or-lstms}

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [cite] and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [cite] networks process the sequence \textbf{sequentially} this is each new state depends on the previous one. This has two important consequences:
1. Information must flow through many time steps, which can lead to vanishing or exploding gradients and makes it hard to model very
long-range interactions. 2. Poor parallelization because each step
depends on the previous one, you cannot compute all time steps in
parallel. Training and inference are inherently sequential. Transformers
address both issues: - Global interactions in one step, self-attention
allows every position to directly interact with every other position in
a \emph{single} layer, which is ideal when we care about
\emph{all-to-all} correlations (as in many-electron systems, where each
electron ``feels'' all the others). - Full parallelism over sequence
length. Given \(\mathbf{X}\), the matrices \(\mathbf{Q}\),
\(\mathbf{K}\), \(\mathbf{V}\) and the attention outputs for all time
steps are computed via matrix multiplications. This is extremely
efficient on modern accelerators (GPUs/TPUs). For a many-electron
Schrödinger equation, the wave function depends on the joint
configuration of all particles. A Transformer-based ansatz naturally
provides a way for each electron's representation to \textbf{look at all
other electrons} and the nuclei, capturing complex correlation patterns
through attention, while remaining highly parallelizable.

A very important work for us is FermiNet (Pfau et al.~2020). It uses
deep neural networks to represent \textbf{orbitals} and then combines
them into a sum of Slater determinants. At the top level, the ansatz is
a linear combination of \(K\) determinant products \[
\psi(\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n)
= \sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k \,\det[\Phi^{k}],
\] where \(\omega_k\) are learnable coefficients and \(\Phi^k\) is a
matrix of single-particle orbitals. For a system without explicit spin
separation one can write \[
\det[\Phi^k] =
\begin{vmatrix}
\phi_{1}^{k}(\mathbf{x}_{1})  & \dots  &  \phi_{1}^{k}(\mathbf{x}_{n}) \\
\vdots   &  & \vdots  \\
\phi_{n}^{k}(\mathbf{x}_{1}) & \dots & \phi_{n}^{k}(\mathbf{x}_{n})
\end{vmatrix}
= \det[\phi_i^k(\mathbf{x}_j)].
\] Here \(\phi_i^k\) is the \(i\)-th orbital in determinant \(k\), and
we evaluate it on the coordinates of electron \(j\).

However, in FermiNet we are dealing with electrons with spin, so things
are slightly more structured, and the orbitals depend on \textbf{all}
electron coordinates, not only on the one being ``plugged in''. That is
why we write the orbitals as \[
\phi^{k\alpha}_i\big(\mathbf{r}^\alpha_j;\{\mathbf{r}^\alpha_{/j}\};\{\mathbf{r}^{\bar{\alpha}}\}\big),
\] where: - \(\alpha \in \{\uparrow,\downarrow\}\) is the spin sector, -
\(\mathbf{r}^\alpha_j\) is the position of electron \(j\) with spin
\(\alpha\), - \(\{\mathbf{r}^\alpha_{/j}\}\) denotes the positions of
all \textbf{other} electrons with spin \(\alpha\), -
\(\{\mathbf{r}^{\bar{\alpha}}\}\) denotes the positions of electrons
with the opposite spin.

So the orbital evaluated on electron \(j\) ``knows'' about all other
electrons. The indices: - \(i\) = orbital index (row of the
determinant), - \(j\) = electron index (column of the determinant), -
\(\alpha,\beta\) = spin labels (\(\uparrow\) or \(\downarrow\)), - \(k\)
= determinant index in the sum.



\section{Psi Former Model}\label{psi-former-model}

\subsection{Fermi Net}\label{fermi-net}

A very important work for us is FermiNet (Pfau et al.~2020). It uses
deep neural networks to represent \textbf{orbitals} and then combines
them into a sum of Slater determinants. At the top level, the ansatz is
a linear combination of \(K\) determinant products \[
\psi(\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n)
= \sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k \,\det[\Phi^{k}],
\] where \(\omega_k\) are learnable coefficients and \(\Phi^k\) is a
matrix of single-particle orbitals. For a system without explicit spin
separation one can write \[
\det[\Phi^k] =
\begin{vmatrix}
\phi_{1}^{k}(\mathbf{x}_{1})  & \dots  &  \phi_{1}^{k}(\mathbf{x}_{n}) \\
\vdots   &  & \vdots  \\
\phi_{n}^{k}(\mathbf{x}_{1}) & \dots & \phi_{n}^{k}(\mathbf{x}_{n})
\end{vmatrix}
= \det[\phi_i^k(\mathbf{x}_j)].
\] Here \(\phi_i^k\) is the \(i\)-th orbital in determinant \(k\), and
we evaluate it on the coordinates of electron \(j\).

However, in FermiNet we are dealing with electrons with spin, so things
are slightly more structured, and the orbitals depend on \textbf{all}
electron coordinates, not only on the one being ``plugged in''. That is
why we write the orbitals as \[
\phi^{k\alpha}_i\big(\mathbf{r}^\alpha_j;\{\mathbf{r}^\alpha_{/j}\};\{\mathbf{r}^{\bar{\alpha}}\}\big),
\] where: - \(\alpha \in \{\uparrow,\downarrow\}\) is the spin sector, -
\(\mathbf{r}^\alpha_j\) is the position of electron \(j\) with spin
\(\alpha\), - \(\{\mathbf{r}^\alpha_{/j}\}\) denotes the positions of
all \textbf{other} electrons with spin \(\alpha\), -
\(\{\mathbf{r}^{\bar{\alpha}}\}\) denotes the positions of electrons
with the opposite spin.

So the orbital evaluated on electron \(j\) ``knows'' about all other
electrons. The indices: - \(i\) = orbital index (row of the
determinant), - \(j\) = electron index (column of the determinant), -
\(\alpha,\beta\) = spin labels (\(\uparrow\) or \(\downarrow\)), - \(k\)
= determinant index in the sum.

\subsubsection{Input coordinates and
features}\label{input-coordinates-and-features-1}

We denote by -
\(\mathbf{r}^\uparrow_1,\dots,\mathbf{r}^\uparrow_{n^\uparrow}\) the
coordinates of spin-up electrons, -
\(\mathbf{r}^\downarrow_1,\dots,\mathbf{r}^\downarrow_{n^\downarrow}\)
the coordinates of spin-down electrons, - \(\mathbf{R}_I\) the positions
of nuclei, \(I=1,\dots,N_\text{nuc}\).

The network builds two types of features:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Electron--nucleus features} for each electron \(i\) with spin
  \(\alpha\): \[
  \mathbf{h}^{0,\alpha}_i
  = \text{concatenate}\Big(
      \mathbf{r}^\alpha_i - \mathbf{R}_I,\;
      \big|\mathbf{r}^\alpha_i - \mathbf{R}_I\big|
      \ \forall\, I
    \Big).
  \] This produces a feature vector that contains, for electron
  \((i,\alpha)\), all its relative position vectors to each nucleus,
  plus their distances.
\item
  \textbf{Electron--electron features} for each pair of electrons
  \((i,\alpha)\) and \((j,\beta)\): \[
  \mathbf{h}^{0,\alpha\beta}_{ij}
  = \text{concatenate}\Big(
      \mathbf{r}^\alpha_i - \mathbf{r}^\beta_j,\;
      \big|\mathbf{r}^\alpha_i - \mathbf{r}^\beta_j\big|
      \ \forall\, j,\beta
    \Big).
  \] For fixed \((i,\alpha)\), we build such features for all other
  electrons \((j,\beta)\), capturing their relative positions and
  distances.
\end{enumerate}

The superscript \(0\) indicates that these are the features at layer
\(\ell=0\) (input to the deep network). At deeper layers we will keep
updating - \(\mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha}_i\) (single-electron features), -
\(\mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha\beta}_{ij}\) (pairwise features), for
\(\ell = 0,1,\dots,L-1\).


\subsubsection{Mixing and updating features across
layers}\label{mixing-and-updating-features-across-layers-1}

At each hidden layer \(\ell\), we want each electron's features to
depend on \emph{all} other electrons, in a permutation-symmetric way. To
do this, we form \textbf{averages} over electrons of the same or
opposite spin.

First, define global spin-averaged single-electron features \[
\mathbf{g}^{\ell\uparrow} =
\frac{1}{n^\uparrow}\sum_{j=1}^{n^\uparrow}\mathbf{h}^{\ell\uparrow}_j,
\qquad
\mathbf{g}^{\ell\downarrow} =
\frac{1}{n^\downarrow}\sum_{j=1}^{n^\downarrow}\mathbf{h}^{\ell\downarrow}_j.
\]

Next, for each electron \((i,\alpha)\), define averaged pairwise
features: \[
\mathbf{g}^{\ell\alpha\uparrow}_i
= \frac{1}{n^\uparrow}\sum_{j=1}^{n^\uparrow}\mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha\uparrow}_{ij},
\qquad
\mathbf{g}^{\ell\alpha\downarrow}_i
= \frac{1}{n^\downarrow}\sum_{j=1}^{n^\downarrow}\mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha\downarrow}_{ij}.
\]

Now we \emph{concatenate} all this information into a single feature
vector for electron \((i,\alpha)\): 
\begin{align}
&\big(
\mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha}_i,
\frac{1}{n^\uparrow}\sum_{j=1}^{n^\uparrow}\mathbf{h}^{\ell\uparrow}_j,
\frac{1}{n^\downarrow}\sum_{j=1}^{n^\downarrow}\mathbf{h}^{\ell\downarrow}_j,
\frac{1}{n^\uparrow}\sum_{j=1}^{n^\uparrow}\mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha\uparrow}_{ij},
\frac{1}{n^\downarrow}\sum_{j=1}^{n^\downarrow}\mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha\downarrow}_{ij}
\big)
\\=&
\big(\mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha}_i, \mathbf{g}^{\ell\uparrow}, \mathbf{g}^{\ell\downarrow},
\mathbf{g}^{\ell\alpha\uparrow}_i, \mathbf{g}^{\ell\alpha\downarrow}_i \big)  = \mathbf{f}^{\ell\alpha}_i.
\end{align}


This \(\mathbf{f}^{\ell\alpha}_i\) is what enters the
\textbf{single-electron MLP} at layer \(\ell\). The update is \[
\mathbf{h}^{\ell+1,\alpha}_i
= \tanh\big(\mathbf{V}^\ell \mathbf{f}^{\ell\alpha}_i + \mathbf{b}^\ell\big) + \mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha}_i,
\] where \(\mathbf{V}^\ell\) and \(\mathbf{b}^\ell\) are learnable
weights and biases, shared between electrons (for the given spin
sector). The residual connection \(+\mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha}_i\)
stabilizes training.

In parallel, the pairwise features are updated with a \textbf{pairwise
MLP}: \[
\mathbf{h}^{\ell+1,\alpha\beta}_{ij}
= \tanh\big(\mathbf{W}^\ell \mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha\beta}_{ij} + \mathbf{c}^\ell\big)
+ \mathbf{h}^{\ell\alpha\beta}_{ij},
\] with weights \(\mathbf{W}^\ell\) and biases \(\mathbf{c}^\ell\),
again shared over all pairs \((i,j,\alpha,\beta)\).

By repeating these updates for \(\ell = 0,\dots,L-1\), we eventually
obtain \textbf{final single-electron features} \[
\mathbf{h}^{L\alpha}_j \quad \text{for each electron } j \text{ of spin } \alpha.
\] Notice how the indices work: - \(\ell\) runs over layers and
disappears at the end, - \(i\) or \(j\) always refer to a specific
electron within a spin sector, - \(\alpha,\beta\) tell you which spin
sector that electron belongs to.

\subsubsection{From final features to
orbitals}\label{from-final-features-to-orbitals-1}

The final orbitals are built as a function of the last-layer features
\(\mathbf{h}^{L\alpha}_j\), plus some additional ``envelope'' factors
that handle the long-range decay and cusp conditions. For each
determinant index \(k\), spin \(\alpha\), orbital index \(i\), and
electron \(j\) we define 
\[
\begin{aligned}
\phi^{k\alpha}_i\big(\mathbf{r}^\alpha_j; \{\mathbf{r}^\alpha_{/j}\}; \{\mathbf{r}^{\bar{\alpha}}\}\big)
&= \left(\mathbf{w}^{k\alpha}_i \cdot \mathbf{h}^{L\alpha}_j + g^{k\alpha}_i\right) \\
\times & \sum_{m} \pi^{k\alpha}_{im}
\exp\Big(
- \big|\mathbf{\Sigma}_{im}^{k\alpha} \big(\mathbf{r}^{\alpha}_j - \mathbf{R}_m\big)\big|
\Big)
\end{aligned}
\] 
Here: - \(\mathbf{w}^{k\alpha}_i\) and \(g^{k\alpha}_i\) are
learnable linear parameters for the ``MLP part'' of the orbital, - the
sum over \(m\) is an ``envelope'' over nuclei (or centers), -
\(\pi^{k\alpha}_{im}\) and \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^{k\alpha}_{im}\) are
learnable coefficients and matrices controlling the exponential decay
around nucleus \(m\).

All these parameters depend on the indices: - \(k\) selects which
determinant in the sum, - \(i\) selects which orbital (row in the
determinant), - \(\alpha\) selects the spin sector, - \(m\) selects
which nuclear center in the envelope.

The dependence on all other electrons is hidden inside
\(\mathbf{h}^{L\alpha}_j\), which was built from the full set of
positions \(\{\mathbf{r}^\uparrow\},\{\mathbf{r}^\downarrow\}\) through
the deep network.


\subsubsection{Assembling the spin-separated
determinants}\label{assembling-the-spin-separated-determinants-1}

For each determinant index \(k\) and spin sector
\(\alpha\in\{\uparrow,\downarrow\}\), we build a matrix \[
D^{k\alpha}_{ij}
= \phi^{k\alpha}_i\big( \mathbf{r}^\alpha_j; \{\mathbf{r}^\alpha_{/j}\}; \{\mathbf{r}^{\bar{\alpha}}\}\big),
\] with: - rows indexed by the orbital label \(i = 1,\dots,n^\alpha\), -
columns indexed by the electron label \(j = 1,\dots,n^\alpha\) (with
that spin).

Taking the determinant gives a properly antisymmetric function of the
positions of electrons \textbf{with that spin}: \[
\det\big[D^{k\alpha}\big]
= \det\left[\phi^{k\alpha}_i(\mathbf{r}^\alpha_j; \{\mathbf{r}^\alpha_{/j}\}; \{\mathbf{r}^{\bar{\alpha}}\})\right].
\]

For the full wavefunction, we combine spin-up and spin-down blocks:
\begin{align}
\psi(\mathbf{r}^\uparrow_1,\ldots,\mathbf{r}^\uparrow_{n^\uparrow},
     \mathbf{r}^\downarrow_1,\ldots,\mathbf{r}^\downarrow_{n^\downarrow})
=\ \sum_{k} \omega_k det[D]det[D]
\end{align}
We have don't explained why we can write the determinant as that
product. In electronic structure, when we separate spin and spatial
parts using spin-orbitals, the full Slater determinant over all
electrons factorizes into the product of: one determinant involving only
spin-up electrons, another determinant involving only spin-down
electrons.

Each of these determinants is antisymmetric under exchange of two
electrons \textbf{with the same spin}. The overall wavefunction
constructed as the product of a spin-up determinant and a spin-down
determinant is antisymmetric under exchange of any two electrons (when you take into account the spin labels). FermiNet keeps this structure and lets each block be represented by a powerful neural network ansatz for the orbitals.
Up to this point the building blocks are just MLP layers (with residual
connections and special feature mixing), but the careful indexing -
\((i,\alpha)\) for ``which electron/spin'', - \(j\) for summation over
electrons, - \(\ell\) for layers, - \(k\) for determinant index, is what
guarantees that the final object has the correct permutation symmetry
and antisymmetry required for a fermionic wavefunction.

\subsection{Applying Attention to Fermi Net
(Psiformer-style)}\label{applying-attention-to-fermi-net-psiformer-style}

\subsubsection{Jastrow Factor for Psi
Former}\label{jastrow-factor-for-psi-former}
[cite self attention]

The Psiformer wavefunction has the usual Slater-Jastrow Ansatz  \cite{foulkes2001quantum}:
\[
\Psi_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})
=
\exp\big(\mathcal{J}_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})\big)\,
\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\det}}\det[\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{k}_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})],
\] where \(\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\dots,x_N)\) is the collection of all \(N\)
electron states \[
x_i = (\mathbf{r}_i,\sigma_i), \qquad \mathbf{r}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3,\;\sigma_i \in \{\uparrow,\downarrow\}.
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\mathcal{J}_\theta:(\mathbb{R}^{3}\times \{\uparrow,\downarrow\})^{N}\to \mathbb{R}\)
  is the \textbf{Jastrow factor}, encoding (here) only
  electron--electron cusp information.
\item
  \(\boldsymbol{\Phi}^k_\theta\) is the matrix of (spin-)orbitals for
  determinant \(k\).
\end{itemize}

In Psiformer, the Jastrow factor is \emph{very} simple: it has only two
learnable parameters, one for parallel-spin pairs and one for
antiparallel-spin pairs: 

\begin{align}
\mathcal{J}_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})
=
\sum_{i<j;\,\sigma_{i}=\sigma_{j}}
-\frac{1}{4}\frac{\alpha^{2}_{\mathrm{par}}}{\alpha_{\mathrm{par}}+\lvert \mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j} \rvert }
+ \\
\sum_{i,j;\,\sigma_{i}\neq \sigma_{j}}
-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\alpha^{2}_{\mathrm{anti}}}{\alpha_{\mathrm{anti}}+\lvert \mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j} \rvert }.
\end{align}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \(\alpha_{\mathrm{par}}\) controls the strength of the Jastrow for
  \textbf{same-spin} electron pairs.
\item
  \(\alpha_{\mathrm{anti}}\) does the same for \textbf{opposite-spin}
  pairs.
\end{itemize}

This Jastrow is responsible for enforcing the electron--electron cusp
conditions. The neural network itself (the Psiformer) only sees
\textbf{electron--nucleus} information in its attention stream; all
explicit \(|\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j|\) dependence lives in
\(\mathcal{J}_\theta\).


Conceptually, Psiformer is ``FermiNet with the two-electron stream
replaced by self-attention'', we can see it clearly doing.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  FermiNet: separate one-electron and two-electron feature streams, then
  mix.
\item
  Psiformer: a \textbf{single stream} of self-attention layers on
  electron--nuclear features only; electron--electron features enter
  only via the Jastrow.
\end{itemize}

We now explain the indices and equations carefully.  

\textbf{Indices}

We will use:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(i,j = 1,\dots,N\): electron indices.
\item
  \(I = 1,\dots,N_{\text{nuc}}\): nucleus index.
\item
  \(\sigma_i \in \{\uparrow,\downarrow\}\): spin of electron \(i\).
\item
  \(\ell = 0,\dots,L-1\): layer index in the Psiformer.
\item
  \(h = 1,\dots,H\): attention head index.
\item
  \(k = 1,\dots,N_{\det}\): determinant index.
\item
  \(d\): hidden dimension of the per-electron feature vectors. So at
  each layer \(\ell\), each electron \(i\) carries a feature (hidden
  state) \[
  \mathbf{h}_i^{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}.
  \]
\end{itemize}

Input features and initial hidden states

Psiformer only uses \textbf{electron--nuclear} features (plus spin) as
input to the attention stack. For each electron \(i\): 1. Let
\(\mathbf{R}_I\) be nuclear positions. 2. Build raw features by
concatenating for all \(I\): - some function of
\(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}_I\) (relative position), -
\(|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}_I|\) (distance), - and the spin as a scalar
(e.g.~\(\sigma_i = +1\) for \(\uparrow\), \(-1\) for \(\downarrow\)).

In the paper they rescale the electron--nucleus vectors so that large
distances grow only logarithmically, but at the level of notation we can
just write \[
\mathbf{f}_i^{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{in}}}
\quad\text{(electron–nucleus features + spin)}.
\] These are then mapped into the model hidden dimension by a linear
layer \[
\mathbf{h}_{i}^{0} = \mathbf{W}^{0}\,\mathbf{f}_{i}^{0},
\] where \(\mathbf{W}^0 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_{\text{in}}}\) is
learned. So: - index \(i\) is ``which electron'', - superscript \(0\)
means ``before any attention layers.'' 

\textbf{One self-attention layer}

At layer \(\ell\), we have all electron hidden states \[
\mathbf{h}_1^{\ell},\dots,\mathbf{h}_N^{\ell}.
\]

For each \textbf{head} \(h\) and electron \(i\), we compute:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Query: \[
  \mathbf{q}^{\ell h}_i = \mathbf{W}^{\ell h}_q \mathbf{h}^{\ell}_i
  \]
\item
  Key: \[
  \mathbf{k}^{\ell h}_i = \mathbf{W}^{\ell h}_k \mathbf{h}^{\ell}_i
  \]
\item
  Value: \[
  \mathbf{v}^{\ell h}_i = \mathbf{W}^{\ell h}_v \mathbf{h}^{\ell}_i
  \]
\end{itemize}

Here each
\(\mathbf{W}^{\ell h}_q,\mathbf{W}^{\ell h}_k,\mathbf{W}^{\ell h}_v\) is
a learned matrix, shared across all electrons \(i\), but specific to
layer \(\ell\) and head \(h\).

Then the \textbf{self-attention output for electron \(i\), head \(h\)}
is \[
\mathbf{A}^{\ell h}_i
=
\sum_{j=1}^{N}
\underbrace{
\frac{\exp\big((\mathbf{q}^{\ell h}_i)^{\mathsf T}\mathbf{k}^{\ell h}_j / \sqrt{d_k}\big)}
     {\sum_{j'=1}^N \exp\big((\mathbf{q}^{\ell h}_i)^{\mathsf T}\mathbf{k}^{\ell h}_{j'} / \sqrt{d_k}\big)}
}_{\text{attention weight from } i \text{ to } j}
\mathbf{v}^{\ell h}_j.
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(j\) runs over ``all other electrons,'' so electron \(i\) ``looks''
  at all others via attention.
\item
  \(d_k\) is the key/query dimension (usually \(d_k = d/H\) or similar).
\end{itemize}

This is exactly your \[
A^{\ell}_{h} = [\text{SelfAttn}(\mathbf{h}_1^\ell,\dots,\mathbf{h}_N^\ell;\mathbf{W}^{\ell h}_q,\mathbf{W}^{\ell h}_k,\mathbf{W}^{\ell h}_v)],
\] but now written explicitly with indices \(i\) and \(j\).

Next, we \textbf{concatenate over heads} for each electron: \[
\mathbf{A}^{\ell}_i = \text{concat}_{h=1}^H\big[\mathbf{A}^{\ell h}_i\big]
\in \mathbb{R}^{Hd_v},
\] where \(d_v\) is the value dimension of each head.

This is your \[
A^{\ell} = \text{concat}_{h}[A_{h}],
\] but again with the electron index \(i\) made explicit.

\subsubsection{Residual projection and
MLP}\label{residual-projection-and-mlp}

We then map the concatenated attention output back to the hidden
dimension and add a residual connection: \[
\mathbf{f}_{i}^{\ell+1}
=
\mathbf{h}_{i}^{\ell}
+
\mathbf{W}_{o}^{\ell}\,\mathbf{A}^{\ell}_i,
\] where \(\mathbf{W}_{o}^{\ell}\) is a learned matrix.

Then we pass this through a small MLP (just a linear + \(\tanh\) here),
again with a residual: \[
\mathbf{h}_{i}^{\ell+1}
=
\mathbf{f}_{i}^{\ell+1}
+
\tanh\big(\mathbf{W}^{\ell+1}\mathbf{f}_{i}^{\ell+1} + \mathbf{b}^{\ell+1}\big).
\]

So a full Psiformer layer \(\ell\) is:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Self-attention: \(\{\mathbf{h}_i^\ell\} \to \{\mathbf{A}^\ell_i\}\).
\item
  Linear + residual:
  \(\{\mathbf{A}^\ell_i\} \to \{\mathbf{f}_i^{\ell+1}\}\).
\item
  MLP + residual:
  \(\{\mathbf{f}_i^{\ell+1}\} \to \{\mathbf{h}_i^{\ell+1}\}\).
\end{enumerate}

Repeat this for \(\ell=0,\dots,L-1\) and you get \textbf{final hidden
states} \[
\mathbf{h}_j^{L} \quad \text{for each electron } j.
\] Here: - \(L\) = number of layers in the Psiformer. - For each layer,
\(i\) indexes the electron the output belongs to, \(j\) indexes
electrons we attend over. - \(h\) indexes different heads in multi-head
attention.

\subsubsection{From hidden states to orbitals and
determinants}\label{from-hidden-states-to-orbitals-and-determinants}

From the final hidden states \(\mathbf{h}_j^L\), we build the
spin-orbital matrix for each determinant \(k\).

For each determinant index \(k\) and orbital index \(i\), define a
\textbf{linear ``orbital head''}: \[
\tilde{\phi}^{k}_i(x_j)
=
\mathbf{w}^{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{h}^{L}_j
+
g^{k}_i,
\] where \(\mathbf{w}^{k}_i\) and \(g^{k}_i\) are learned. The
dependence on spin \(\sigma_j\) and all other electrons is implicit in
\(\mathbf{h}_j^L\): the self-attention layers have already mixed that
information in.

Then we multiply by an \textbf{envelope} to enforce the correct
asymptotic decay: \[
\Omega^{k}_{ij}
=
\sum_{m}
\pi^{k}_{im}
\exp\big(
- \big|\mathbf{\Sigma}^{k}_{im}(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{R}_m)\big|
\big),
\] where - \(m\) indexes nuclei (or ``envelope centers''), -
\(\pi^{k}_{im}\) and \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^{k}_{im}\) are learned
parameters.

The final spin-orbital entries are \[
\Phi^{k}_{ij}
=
\Omega^{k}_{ij}\,
\tilde{\phi}^{k}_i(x_j).
\]

Collecting these into the matrix \[
\boldsymbol{\Phi}^k(\mathbf{x}) = 
\big[\Phi^{k}_{ij}\big]_{i,j=1}^N,
\] we form the determinant \[
\det[\boldsymbol{\Phi}^k(\mathbf{x})]
=
\det\big[\Phi^{k}_{ij}\big]
=
\det\big[\phi^{k}_i(x_j)\big],
\] and finally the full Psiformer wavefunction \[
\Psi_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})
=
\exp(\mathcal{J}_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}))
\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\det}}\det[\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{k}_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})].
\]

So the story in terms of indices is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(i\) = which \textbf{orbital} (row of the determinant).
\item
  \(j\) = which \textbf{electron} the orbital is evaluated on (column of
  the determinant).
\item
  \(k\) = which \textbf{determinant} in the sum.
\item
  \(\ell\) = which \textbf{layer} of the attention/MLP stack produced
  the hidden states.
\item
  \(h\) = which \textbf{attention head} participated in mixing
  information across electrons.
\item
  \(I,m\) = which \textbf{nucleus/center} is used for the envelope.
\end{itemize}

The self-attention layers are what let \(\mathbf{h}_j^L\) depend on all
other electrons in a flexible, learned way, while the determinant over
\(i,j\) and the Jastrow over \(i,j\) enforce fermionic antisymmetry and
cusp conditions.

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}
To implement the code, the choose of the library is important. The three
options to implement this kind of matter are JAX, Tensor Flow and
pytorch, each one with his advantages and disadvantages.

\subsection{Environment}

For this project we are going to be using Pytorch due his user-friendly and support. Python, and several libraries as transformers from hugging face, a library who implements KFCA and like guide the implement of Fermi Net by google deepmind which is made it on TensorFlow.

Project manager with UV. 

\subsection{Training}

Due the high computational power needed we are going to using GPUS mention by the authors. Several weeks to train molecules
and of course CUDA. Is clear that we are going to use virtual GPUS, for that matter we have two option or well use a GPU via SSH or directly using services like Azure , Colab, or anothers matters. For simplicity we are going to use Colab services or RunPod. The election of the GPU is not trivial. use TPUS are not a bad idea.
