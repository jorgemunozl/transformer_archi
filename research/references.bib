  abstract = {Accurately solving the Schrödinger equation for intricate systems remains a prominent challenge in physical sciences. Here we present QiankunNet, a neural network quantum state (NNQS) framework that combines Transformer architectures with efficient autoregressive sampling to solve the many-electron Schrödinger equation. At its core is a Transformer-based wave function ansatz that captures complex quantum correlations through attention mechanisms, effectively learning the structure of many-body states. The quantum state sampling employs layer-wise Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) that naturally enforces electron number conservation while exploring orbital configurations. The framework incorporates physics-informed initialization using truncated configuration interaction solutions, providing principled starting points for variational optimization. Our systematic benchmarks demonstrate QiankunNet’s versatility across different chemical systems. For molecular systems up to 30 spin orbitals, we achieved correlation energies reaching 99.9\% of the full configuration interaction (FCI) benchmark, setting a new standard for neural network quantum states. Most notably, in treating the Fenton reaction mechanism, a fundamental process in biological oxidative stress, QiankunNet successfully handled a large CAS(46e,26o) active space, enabling accurate description of the complex electronic structure evolution during Fe(II) to Fe(III) oxidation.}

  abstract = {We introduce physics-informed neural networks – neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},
